Hello!

This program is technically an application that run different benchmarks for different operations (like adding two 
fixed-point or floating-point numbers, or computing some big matrices and see the time they need to update). You can run the 
program by executing the main from the MainGUI class, where you can select any operation you want by pressing the button
for that.
