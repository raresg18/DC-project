Hello!

This program is technically an application that run different benchmarks for different operations (like adding two 
fixed-point or floating-point numbers, or computing some big matrices and see the time they need to update). You can run the 
program by executing the main from the MainGUI class, where you can select any operation you want by pressing the button
for that.

Also, in order to run the File Processing Operation, you will need to create a plain .bin (or any type) file and copy its path 
into the RandomFileGenerator class (I wanted to include the file, but Git does not allow to push files bigger than 100 MB or smth like that and that file is 1 GB).
